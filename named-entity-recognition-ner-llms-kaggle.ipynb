Let me read through the text carefully and identify each entity.\n\nFirst sentence mentions President Barack Obama delivering a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York on September 24, 2014. So, the entities here are \"President Barack Obama\" and \"United Nations General Assembly.\" The types are Person and Organization respectively.\n\nNext part talks about Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praising the US. That's another Person, \"Ban Ki-moon,\" and the organization is still the United Nations.\n\nMoving on, Apple Inc. is mentioned as unveiling the iPhone 6. So, Apple Inc. is an Organization, and the iPhone 6 is a Product.\n\nTim Cook is the CEO of Apple, so he's a Person. Then there's Google, which is an Organization, and they're developing Gemini, which is an Advanced AI System. Wait, but the user wants the type as 'Advanced AI System' or just 'AI'? Hmm, probably better to stick with what's written, so it's an Entity called Gemini with type Advanced AI System.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are mentioned. Both are Persons, Chancellor and President respectively. The European Union is an Organization, and the European Central Bank is another Organization.\n\nOn the sports side, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are Persons, both related to Sports. The Copa America Final was held at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, so Stadium is a Location.\n\nIn the business world, Elon is mentioned, but without his last name, so maybe it's incomplete? Or perhaps it's a typo. Since the text ends abruptly, I'll note Elon as a Person but leave it at that.\n\nI think that's all. Now, compiling them into the required format.\n</think>\n\n[(Entity: President Barack Obama, Type: Person), (Entity: United Nations General Assembly, Type: Organization), (Entity: Ban Ki-moon, Type: Person), (Entity: Apple Inc., Type: Organization), (Entity: Tim Cook, Type: Person), (Entity: Google, Type: Organization), (Entity: Gemini, Type: Advanced AI System), (Entity: Angela Merkel, Type: Person), (Entity: Emmanuel Macron, Type: Person), (Entity: European Union, Type: Organization), (Entity: European Central Bank, Type: Organization), (Entity: Lionel Messi, Type: Person), (Entity: Cristiano Ronaldo, Type: Person), (Entity: Maracana Stadium, Type: Stadium)]\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n\n===========================\n📌 **Chunk**: in a historic moment, president barack obama delivered a speech at the united nations general assembly in new york on september 24, 2014. during his address, he emphasized the importance of global cooperation in tackling climate change, economic disparities, and political instability. the united nations secretary - general ban ki - moon praised the united states for its commitment to international diplomacy. meanwhile, in silicon valley, apple inc. unveiled its latest product, the iphone 6, at the steve jobs theater in cupertino, california. ceo tim cook stated that the new device would revolutionize mobile technology. google, headquartered in mountain view, california, also announced the development of an advanced ai system, gemini, to enhance search capabilities. across the atlantic, german chancellor angela merkel met with french president emmanuel macron in paris to discuss the european union ’ s economic strategies. the european central bank, based in frankfurt, germany, outlined a new financial policy to address inflation concerns. on the sports front, lionel messi led argentina to victory against brazil in the copa america final held at the maracana stadium in rio de janeiro. cristiano ronaldo, playing for manchester united, set another record in the english premier league, scoring his 800th career goal. in the business world, elon\n🔍 **Extracted Entities**: [{'Entity': 'ENTITY_NAME', 'Type': 'ENTITY_TYPE'}, {'Entity': 'President Barack Obama', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'United Nations General Assembly', 'Type': 'Organization'}, {'Entity': 'Ban Ki-moon', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'Apple Inc.', 'Type': 'Organization'}, {'Entity': 'Tim Cook', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'Google', 'Type': 'Organization'}, {'Entity': 'Gemini', 'Type': 'Advanced AI System'}, {'Entity': 'Angela Merkel', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'European Union', 'Type': 'Organization'}, {'Entity': 'European Central Bank', 'Type': 'Organization'}, {'Entity': 'Lionel Messi', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Type': 'Person'}, {'Entity': 'Maracana Stadium', 'Type': 'Stadium'}]\n===========================\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n\n🔹 Raw Model Response:\n Extract named entities and their types from the following text:\n    \n    musk ’ s company, tesla, announced plans to build a new gigafactory in austin, texas. meanwhile, amazon expanded its cloud services under the aws division, competing with microsoft azure and google cloud. jeff bezos, the founder of amazon, spoke at the global entrepreneurship summit in san francisco about the future of e - commerce. meanwhile, in asia, china ’ s president xi jinping met with indian prime minister narendra modi in beijing to discuss trade relations between their two nations. the asian development bank, headquartered in manila, philippines, approved a multi - billion - dollar loan for infrastructure projects across southeast asia. in the field of medicine, dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, addressed concerns about global pandemics at the world health organization ’ s headquarters in geneva, switzerland. finally, in entertainment news, the academy awards took place in hollywood, california, where director christopher nolan won the oscar for best director for his film \" oppenheimer. \" taylor swift, who performed at madison square garden in new york, won album of the year at the grammy awards. as the world continues to evolve, new technological advancements, economic policies, and political developments shape our global society.\n    \n    Return results as a structured list of entities.
